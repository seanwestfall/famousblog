<b>The symbolism of goldfish</b>
<p>The goldfish brings good luck in the form of tranquility, wisdom and long life. It is one among the eight sacred symbols of the Buddha where they represent fertility, abundance and harmony with the flow of life. Ancient Greeks believed goldfish enhanced good luck in marriage and relationships. In ancient Egypt goldfish were kept in the house as a lucky omen for the family and helped cheer up domestic situations.</p>

<b>A little bit about myself</b>
<p>My name is Sean. I currently live in Long Beach, California -- a neighborhood in Los Angeles County in Southern California. Though, I've lived in Chicago, Honolulu, and Maui, Hawaii (my birth place). I'm currently working as a web developer on ModelMayhem: A social networking site for photographers and models. Though I know a lot about programming and computer science I'd prefer to focus on the big picture and discuss topics that appeal to a larger audience (as opposed to just technicians and people with expert knowledge), so I wont be writing much about those subjects. This blog will be predominately about tea and poetry, though I may discuss other things if I feel inclined.</p>
