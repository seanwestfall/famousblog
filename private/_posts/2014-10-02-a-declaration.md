## A Declaration
Model Mayhem released a new version of it's homepage this week. It looks really good, but my PM mentioned to me he got a lot of complaint about it. Model Mayhem is finally starting to look decent and professional. I've been working on a new member only dashboard UI built in AngularJS for sending and receiving messages, amongst many other things, for the past 3 weeks -- and this week we are pushing it up to staging so the QA can take a look. It still has bugs, and that's probably what I'll be working on throughout the rest of this week.


At home, I've been working on building a portfolio website for myself in middleman -- a static site server in rails that runs on puma -- and as soon as that is finished I'm going to build a blog in Meteorjs. My portfolio should be up shortly.


Beyond what's happening in the coding world I've started taking Japanese classes again, and my second class is tonight! The name of the class is Making Friends 2, and for the most part all my classmates from the last class have taken it a second time. It's really nice to see familiar friendly faces.


-- edit --  
Well, I couldn't help myself, but I decided to show a quick rough draft of my portfolio: [http://afternoon-retreat-6206.herokuapp.com/](http://afternoon-retreat-6206.herokuapp.com/)


It's not finished yet, but a lot of the nicer design features are already in there. I feel very guilty about obsessing over the design and the UI and not over the content, but since it's meant to be a professional portfolio, it needs to be a good example of my work. The inspiration of it comes from the Google material design spec and f.lux (as in the background colors will eventually be like flux, it will be based on the time of day and weather -- right now it's random). There's still a lot of work to be done, and I'll comment on more details later.
